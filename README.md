# BasicStoresCRUDRestAPI
Augmented final code for Udemy Course: "REST APIs with Flask and Python":

    - Course code implements basic CRUD REST API for Stores and Items
    - REST API utilizes various Flask python packages, PostGreSQL and PGAdmin, and an nginx proxy
    - My modifications were to stand up the whole system with Docker (to utilize and test my Docker knowledge)
